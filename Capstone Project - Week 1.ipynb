    "### Problem\n",
    "Very often, people need to move from one place to another. A new job, formation of a family, college admission are some of the most common reasons. A change can also take place in virtue of external problems: armed conflict, poverty, natural disasters, political persecution, etc. But, when arriving at the new location, a question that may eventually arise is: what is the best place to live in this city?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual has unique preferences and needs, which may vary over time, but it's reasonable and legitimate to think that everyone would like to live in a neighborhood that best suits their current expectations. A married person with children may prefer to live closer to where there are more schools and parks, for example. A young single person may prefer somewhere better served by public transport. A couple with no children may prefer to live near restaurants. If the couple is Italian, probably their preferred restaurants should be Italians, not Indians, for example. The desired combinations of amenities are virtually endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Living close to places that are most compatible with current needs and preferences means maximizing personal and familiar happiness. From a philosophical point of view, the pursuit of happiness has always been the subject of study by great philosophers, from Aristoteles, through Kant to Stuart Mill, just to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in addition to the philosophical aspect, and now dealing with a more practical and rational aspect, a good change of address can mean more or less personal and / or family problems. Non-adaptation to a location due to the lack of essential structures may be related to lower work productivity (or even unemployment), emotional instability, disagreements with spouse / children, among other problems. Conversely, good adaptation means greater personal and familiar fulfillment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true, however, that happiness depends not only on a good neighborhood, but all these aspects that affect the happiness escape the scope of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the question to be answered by this project is: **Considering a person's needs, what are the New York City neighborhoods most compatible with them?**\n"

Any entity that is responsible for advising someone to obtain a residence in New York City may be interested in this project.\n"

    "- A city map will be plotted showing the neighborhoods with colors indicating the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By color, the user can check the neighborhoods that best suit what they think is relevant and thus choose the one they like best."
