    "- For each venue, the system will calculate its weight based on the importance given by the user\n",
    "- After thorough analysis, the system will group by neighborhood, adding the weights of their venues\n",
    "- With this, it will be possible to create clusters based on the scores of each neighborhood.\n",
    "- A city map will be plotted showing the neighborhoods with colors indicating the scores.\n",
    "- By color, the user can check the neighborhoods that best suit what he/she thinks is relevant and thus choose the one he/she likes best. "
