    "### Problem\n",
    "Very often, people need to move from one place to another. A new job, raising a family and college admission, for example, are some of the most common reasons for moving around. A change can also take place due to external problems: armed conflicts, poverty, natural disasters, political persecution, etc. But, when arriving at the new location, a question that may eventually arise is: where is the best place to live in this city?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each individual has unique preferences and needs, which may vary over time, but it's reasonable and legitimate to think that everyone would like to live in a neighborhood that best suits their current expectations. A married person with children may prefer to live closer to where there are more schools and parks, for example. A young single person may prefer somewhere better served by public transport. A couple with no children may prefer to live near restaurants. If the couple is Italian, probably their favourite restaurants would be Italian, not Indian, for instance. The desired combinations of amenities are virtually endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Living close to places that are most compatible with current needs and preferences means maximizing personal and familiar happiness. From a philosophical point of view, the pursuit of happiness has always been the subject of study by great philosophers, from Aristoteles, through Kant to Stuart Mill, just to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in addition to the philosophical aspect, and now dealing with a more practical and rational approach, moving from one place to another can result in more or less personal and / or family problems. Lower work productivity (or even unemployment), emotional instability, disagreements with spouse / children, among other problems, can be related to the non-adaptation to a location due to the lack of essential structures needed by the individuals; families. On the other hand,  good adaptation means greater personal and familiar fulfillment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true, however, that happiness depends on many other aspects that are not related to living in a good neighborhood, but all these aspects are beyond the scope of this work.\n",
    "Having said that, the question to be answered by this project is: **Considering a person's needs, which New York City neighborhoods would be most compatible with him/her?**\n"

Any entity that is responsible for advising someone to obtain a residence in New York City may be interested in this project.\n"
